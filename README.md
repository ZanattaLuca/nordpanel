# nordpanel

NordPanel is a lightweight graphical frontend for the official NordVPN CLI on Linux.  
It lets you connect, disconnect and switch countries using a simple desktop panel instead of typing commands in the terminal.

Under the hood, NordPanel just calls the `nordvpn` command, so you still rely on the official NordVPN client while getting a nicer, visual interface.
